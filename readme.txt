Run bash run.sh which will run the simulations for 3 hdx values, 3 nx values and 4 kernels.
hdx can't be changed using --hdx='value' so instead the value of hdx was manually changed in cavity.py
You can find 3 files cavity1.py cavity2.py and cavity3.py with different values of hdx while everything
else is same

The report made was not automated so there might be some problems when running bash run.sh
